Dissimilarity matrix construction
=================================

Here, code is provided for the **Gaussian Process inspired dissimilarity function** between 2 expression profiles used in

https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02872

Due to its simplicity, and speed, the linear cosine dissimilarity function also used in the paper referenced above can be easily implemented. Therefore, it is not provided here.

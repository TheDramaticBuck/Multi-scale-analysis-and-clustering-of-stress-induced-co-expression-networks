Adjusted Mutual Information between multi-scale/multi-resolution partition solution found by stability analysis
===============================================================================================================

The distance function that provided the best results is based on the mutual information (MI) between stress-specific partition solutions at different resolutions. Yet, it is corrected for chance under an hyper-geometric model by the expected value for MI between two partitions and the entropy of each partition.

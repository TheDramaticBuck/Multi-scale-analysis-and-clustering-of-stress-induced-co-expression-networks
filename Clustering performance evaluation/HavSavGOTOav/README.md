This function computes the value of linear performance functions between gene expression profiles grouped in clusters
=====================================================================================================================
Clustering solutions were computed through stability analysis

Clustering performance functions: Hav (average homogeneity), Sav (average separation) and 
GOTOav (average gene ontology term overlap) at each resolution, here quantified by the Markov Time

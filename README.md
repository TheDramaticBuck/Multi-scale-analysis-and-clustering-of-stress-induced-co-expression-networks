PaperWithSupplFigs folder
-------------------------
Paper with all supplementary figures included. Extended version of arxiv. 


Dissimilarity matrix and co-expression network construction folder
------------------------------------------------------------------
The construction of dissimilarity matrices according to the functions outlined above in the paper and an implementation of the RMST algorithm in C++. This algorithm is based on the original code provided by Dr. Vangelov and Professor Barahona. (available soon)


Clustering performance evaluation folder
----------------------------------------
Routines in C++ for evaluation of clustering performance and for comparison with Bayesian clustering analysis. Standard R routines for cutting hierarchical dendrograms using widely available code from bio-conductor are also provided. (available soo)
